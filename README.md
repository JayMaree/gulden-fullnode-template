# gulden-fullnode-template
This template can be used for gulden full node installations to promote your node on the web.

I have used the latest Bootstrap, JavaScript and SweetAlert versions to build the template.

An example can be found at http://singapore-node-1.jaymaree.nl

# Serving to the web
I advise you to use a secure and lightweight webserver, for ex. Caddy (https://caddyserver.com).

"Caddy and Let's Encrypt is pretty incredible. A 3-line config file yields a fully A-rated SSL site." - John Resig, Creator of jQuery
